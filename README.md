# nef-to-jpg
This python script converts an entire directory containing nef images to jpg. 

## Time
A timer is implemented to tell you how long it took to process the entire directory. The image progression will also print as it goes.

In the event that the program is interrupted, don't worry. While you'll have to run it from the beginning again, it will simply overwrite the new images it had already processed. It won't make any duplicates. 

I will try to include a few sample images that I find online in here as well :)
