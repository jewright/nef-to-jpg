# nef-to-jpg
This is a short python script to convert a directory with NEF/Raw Images to jpg. 

Use the following to install the requirements:

pip install -r path/to/requirements.txt

The file names will stay the same, and the amount of time it for all images to process depends on the amount an size of the photos. In the event that the program is interrupted, don't worry. While you'll have to run it from the beginning again, it will simply overwrite the ones it had already done. It won't make any duplicates. 

I will include a few sample images that I found online in here as well :)
